# MNIST
Very simple neural network capable of classifying MNIST dataset (accuracy > 95%)

It has input, two hidden and output layers, all linear with LeakyReLU activations. 
I did not use any Conv layer, because MNIST is so simple, that even linear layers can do a job.

If you want to see more complex NN, check my other repos (KMNIST for example).
